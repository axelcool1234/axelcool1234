## HELLO HUMANS!
- I am currently studying to be a full-time software engineer at University of California, Irvine. It's nice to meet you!
- I have had a passion for computer science since I started middle school. Ever since then my interest and passion has continued to grow.
- I especially have a strong interest in programming paradigms and what it means to produce *good* code. Efficient program design is enticing to me.
- I am actively searching for a summer 2024 internship.

### My Projects:
- [axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer](https://github.com/axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer) - Web app for dynamically generating card designs
- [joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped](https://github.com/joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped) - A 12 hour hackathon project designed to find the most common senders in your Gmail inbox. I worked on API handling. The project won 3rd place at UCI's ZotHacks!

### Contact:
The best way to contact me professionally is through my professional email. If you want to contact me casually, it might be best to talk to me on Discord. I'd love to talk to you!

### I'm currently working on:
- Continuing my sophomore year of UCI's computer science program.
    - **Formal Languages and Automata.**: Formal aspects of describing and recognizing languages by grammars and automata. Parsing regular and context-free languages. Ambiguity, nondeterminism. Elements of computability; Turning machines, random access machines, undecidable problems, NP-completeness.
    - **Language Processor Construction.**: Project course which provides working laboratory experience in construction and behavior of compilers and interpreters. Building actual language processors and performing experiments which reveal their behaviors.
    - **Beyond SQL Data Management.**: Survey of modern data management and analysis technologies beyond relational (SQL) database management. Topics include semistructured data, NoSQL databases, big data analysis, and text search/query engines. Additional topics vary and may include data frames, streaming data, and/or time-series data.
- Searching for an internship for next summer.
- As a grader, I also grade and provide feedback for [Professor Thornton's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-thornton-1659603) computer science courses.
