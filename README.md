## HELLO HUMANS!
- I am currently studying to be a full-time software engineer at University of California, Irvine. It's nice to meet you!
- I have had a passion for computer science since I started middle school. Ever since then my interest and passion has continued to grow.
- I have a strong interest in programming language theory and compilers.
- I am actively searching for a summer 2025 internship.

### My Projects:
- [axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer](https://github.com/axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer) - Web app for dynamically generating card designs
- [joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped](https://github.com/joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped) - A 12 hour hackathon project designed to find the most common senders in your Gmail inbox. I worked on API handling. The project won 3rd place at UCI's ZotHacks!

### Contact:
The best way to contact me professionally is through my professional email. If you want to contact me casually, it might be best to talk to me on Discord. I'd love to talk to you!

### I'm currently working on:
- Continuing my junior year of UCI's computer science program.
    - **Type Theory and Programming Languages**: Exploring various type systems, their properties, and their implementation in programming languages. Emphasis will also be placed on proof techniques, functional programming paradigms, and basic theory of programming languages to provide a holistic view of the subject.
    - **Comprehensive Rust Programming: From Basics to Production**: A thorough introduction to Rust programming, progressing from fundamental concepts to building a professional-grade web application. The goal is to gain a solid understanding of Rust and its applications in modern software development.
- As a grader, I also grade and provide feedback for [Professor Thornton's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-thornton-1659603) computer science courses.
