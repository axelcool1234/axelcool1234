## HELLO HUMANS!
- I am currently studying to be a full-time software engineer at University of California, Irvine. It's nice to meet you!
- I have had a passion for computer science since I started middle school. Ever since then my interest and passion has continued to grow.
- I especially have a strong interest in programming paradigms and what it means to produce *good* code. Efficient program design is enticing to me.
- I am currently actively searching for a summer 2024 internship.

### My Projects:
- [axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer](https://github.com/axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer) - Web app for dynamically generating card designs
- [joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped](https://github.com/joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped) - A 12 hour hackathon project designed to find the most common senders in your Gmail inbox. I worked on API handling. The project won 3rd place at UCI's ZotHacks!

### Contact:
The best way to contact me professionally is through my professional email. If you want to contact me casually, it might be best to talk to me on Discord. I'd love to talk to you!

### I'm currently working on:
- Preparing for my sophomore year of UCI's computer science program.
  - **Data Structure Implementation and Analysis**: Focuses on implementation and mathematical analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Covers storage allocation and memory management techniques.
  - **Introductory Computer Organization**: Multilevel view, design, and operation of computer system components. Machine-level data and instruction representation. Instruction sets and addressing modes. Memory organization. Laboratory work using low-level programming languages.
  - **Information Retrieval**: An introduction to information retrieval including indexing, retrieval, classifying, and clustering text and multimedia documents.
- Searching for an internship for next summer. Looking at the bigger picture, I am admittedly applying for internships really early on into my college program but that won't dissuade me!
- Self teaching myself data structures and algorithms ahead of my class (it fascinates me anyways).
- Grading and providing feedback for [Professor Thornton's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-thornton-1659603) accelerated Python Programming and Libraries course.
