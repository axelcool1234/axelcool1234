## HELLO HUMANS!
- I am currently studying to be a full-time software engineer at University of California, Irvine. It's nice to meet you!
- I have had a passion for computer science since I started middle school. Ever since then my interest and passion has continued to grow.
- I especially have a strong interest in programming paradigms and what it means to produce *good* code. Efficient program design is enticing to me.
- I am currently actively searching for a summer 2024 internship.

### My Projects:
- [axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer](https://github.com/axelcool1234/inscryption-card-printer) - Web app for dynamically generating card designs
- [joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped](https://github.com/joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped) - A 12 hour hackathon project designed to find the most common senders in your Gmail inbox. I worked on API handling. The project won 3rd place at UCI's ZotHacks!

### Contact:
The best way to contact me professionally is through my professional email. If you want to contact me casually, it might be best to talk to me on Discord. I'd love to talk to you!

### I'm currently working on:
- Continuing my sophomore year of UCI's computer science program.
  - **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**: Techniques for efficient algorithm design, including divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming, and time/space analysis. Fast algorithms for problems applicable to networks, computer games, and scientific computing, such as sorting, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, network flow, and pattern matching.
  - **Concepts in Programming Languages**: In-depth study of several contemporary programming languages stressing variety in data structures, operations, notation, and control. Examination of different programming paradigms, such as logic programming, functional programming and object-oriented programming; implementation strategies, programming environments, and programming style.
  - **Principles in System Design**: Introduces basic principles of system software: operating systems, compilers, and networking. Exposure to the following topics through theoretical and practical programming experiences: linking and loading, process and memory management, concurrency and synchronization, network communication, programming for performance, etc.
- Programming and experimenting with my custom keyboard I built myself (Piantor). I'm updating its firmware to add additional features to fit my needs, along with practicing typing with it as I've never worked with a columnar staggered split keyboard before.
- Switching from the QWERTY keyboard layout to [Semimak](https://github.com/semilin/semimak). Practicing typing with the new layout to build new muscle memory for it.
- Searching for an internship for next summer. Looking at the bigger picture, I am admittedly applying for internships really early on into my college program but that won't dissuade me!
- As a grader, I also grade and provide feedback for [Professor Thornton's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-thornton-1659603) computer science courses.
