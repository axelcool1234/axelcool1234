## Hello!
My name is Axel Sorenson. Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/axelcool1234/.dotfiles).

### Who Am I?
- I'm an undergraduate UC Irvine compuer science student.
- I'm a lab assistant at the Secure Systems and Software Laboratory at UC Irvine.
- I'm a grader for UC Irvine's ICS 33 course.
- I'm a learning assistant for UC Irvine's ICS 53 course.
- I'm practicing to become an active LLVM contributor.

### Contact:
The best way to contact me professionally is through my professional email. If you want to contact me casually, it might be best to talk to me on Discord. I'd love to talk to you!

### I'm currently working on:
- Finishing up my undergraduate program at UCI (This is my last quarter!) 
    - **[COMPSCI 143A](https://ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/courses/os/index.html). Principles of Operating Systems.** Principles and concepts of process and resource management, especially as seen in operating systems. Processes, memory management, protection, scheduling, file systems, and I/O systems are covered. Concepts illustrated in the context of several well-known systems.
    - **[COMPSCI 145](https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/70394). Embedded Software.** Principles of embedded computing systems: embedded systems architecture, hardware/software components, system software and interfacing, real-time operating systems, hardware/software co-development, and communication issues. Examples of embedded computing in real-world application domains. Simple programming using an embedded systems development environment.
    - **[COMPSCI 146](https://ics.uci.edu/~wayne/courses/cs146/). Programming in Multitasking Operating Systems.** User- and systems-level programming of modern Internet-connected, multi-user, multitasking operating systems. Shells, scripting, filters, pipelines, programmability, extensibility, concurrency, inter-process communication. Concrete examples of a modern operating system (such as, but not necessarily, Unix programmed in C) are used.
    - **[COMPSCI 166](https://www.shionfukuzawa.com/courses/166wi25.html). Quantum Computation and Information.** Basic models for quantum computation and their foundations in quantum mechanics. Quantum complexity classes and quantum algorithms, including algorithms for factoring and quantum simulation. Introduction to quantum information theory and quantum entanglement.
    - **COMPSCI 241. Advanced Compiler Construction.** Advanced study of programming language implementation techniques: optimizations such as common sub-expression elimination, register allocation, and instruction scheduling. Implementation of language features such as type-directed dispatch, garbage collection, dynamic linking, and just-in-time code generation. I've done most of this course in COMPSCI 142B, so I'm auditing it for the additional content.
- **Type Theory and Programming Languages**: Exploring various type systems, their properties, and their implementation in programming languages. Emphasis will also be placed on proof techniques, functional programming paradigms, and basic theory of programming languages to provide a holistic view of the subject.
