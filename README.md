## HELLO HUMANS!
- I am currently studying to be a full-time software engineer at University of California, Irvine. It's nice to meet you!
- I have had a passion for computer science since I started middle school. Ever since then my interest and passion has continued to grow.
- I especially have a strong interest in programming paradigms and what it means to produce *good* code. Efficient program design is enticing to me.
- I am currently actively searching for a summer 2024 internship.

### My Projects:

- [joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped](https://github.com/joeyabsi22/Gmail-Wrapped) - A 12 hour hackathon project designed to find the most common senders in your Gmail inbox. I worked on API handling. The project won 3rd place at UCI's ZotHacks!
